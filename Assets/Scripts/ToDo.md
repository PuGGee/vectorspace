## ToDo

- Pick up cargo from space; from destroyed ships or sometimes just found whilst exploring. Needs some kind of tractor beam for pulling the cargo towards the ship.

- Better UI; this is obviously quite a big one. Will need to be split up into smaller tasks.

- Add content; new ships, new stations, new guns, new mission types.

- Some sort of awesome space backdrop; the plain black background probably won't cut it in the long run. I might give out an initial release of the game to some friends to see if they think a nice background is really necessary.

- Sounds and music; hopefully I can get them for free somewhere. Maybe pay someone for some nice atmospheric music. (Might not be necessary for the initial release)
